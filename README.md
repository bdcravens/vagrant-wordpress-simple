This is bare-bones WordPress on Vagranet setup. It's a short little Chef script. No additional recipes, not highly 
configurable. Just sets up a LAMP setup with Wordpress as the default site.

Keep in mind that some of the directory and database permissions are wide open - definitely not production quality. 
Just enough to do WordPress dev on your local machine.
